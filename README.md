Problem #1
Write code which takes a sentence as an input from the user and then prints the length of the first word in that sentence.
Hint: think about how you know where the first word ends - you may assume that the sentence contains more than one word.

Sample run 1:
Enter a sentence:
Everything in its right place
10

Sample run 2:
Enter a sentence:
Down is the new up
4

Problem#2
Write code to take a String input from the user, then print the first and last letters of the string on one line.

Sample run:
Enter a string:
surcharge
se

Problem #3

Write code to take two words from the user. The program should convert these to lower case, then compare them: printing a positive number if string1 appears after string2 alphabetically, a negative number if string1 appears before string2 alphabetically and zero if the two strings are identical. Make sure your program does not produce any additional numerical output other than this number or it may not be graded correctly.
Hint - while these instructions don't specify a specific number to print, there is a String method which, if used correctly, will produce a number which matches these conditions in all possible cases.

Sample run 1:
Enter first word:
-Sterling
Enter second word:
-material
Result: 6

Sample run 2:
Enter first word:
-framing
Enter second word:
-framiNG
Result: 0
